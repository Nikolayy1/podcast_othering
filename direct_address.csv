I'm just a human being with a soul.,0
I'm just kidding.,0
I got my soul so I genuinely removed.,0
"Hello, hello, and welcome back to A Bit Fruity.",0
"Today, we have a little bit of a different show.",0
This is not usually an interview podcast.,0
"It's usually a culture and political analysis podcast, but I recently got to know someone who really exists at the center of so many conversations.",0
that we have on this podcast but who we have yet to hear from on the fruity podcast mic,0
and so I thought now's the time.,0
I haven't evaded Matt's place of residence.,0
"Welcome to the podcast and welcome to my apartment Vivian, Jenna, Wilson.",0
"Vivian, you have had a whirlwind few months.",1
"I have, yes.",0
"Sort of into public figurehood into this like very strange internet spotlight, which I'm like sort of familiar with, but not nearly probably the way that you are at this point.",1
"And I'm just curious, like, how are you doing right now?",1
I'm doing good.,0
It's definitely like a lot to get used to all at once.,0
"Because it was very much in my specific instance, it was like, there was no training rules, it was zero to 100.",0
"So it's just, it's a bit of a struggle to get like acclimated to it.",0
"But obviously, I'm very grateful for all the support and love I've received and this is just such a unique.",0
experience,0
and I want to enjoy it and like live life to the fullest.,0
You're giving your life.,1
That was the most pageant.,0
You're giving your pageant answer.,1
I'm done.,0
"Hi, thank you.",1
Thank you.,1
Do you want world peace?,1
I got you.,1
"And when I'm called the queen, I'll fight hard for world peace.",0
Thank you.,1
Thank you.,1
This moment means so much to me.,0
I keep getting those fucking cheer videos on my TikTok.,0
"I mean, it's an earnest podcast, but it's not that earnest.",0
That was like real pageant material.,0
That was real.,0
Or was my honest answer?,0
I'm sorry.,0
"Well, but it I mean, it really has come at you so quickly.",1
Vivian got to my apartment a little while ago and we've just been having coffee and chatting it up.,0
It's a really rainy day here in New York.,0
Yeah.,0
And you were telling me about how you went from like 22 followers on threads one day to it's just like ballooning.,1
It blew me up.,0
"Yeah, me nearly.",0
"It went from like literally 22 followers where I was shit posting about kpop and and chatting with the gaggle of other trans people on a dead app to like 60,000 followers or something like that.",0
"In the course of one night, it was like nothing.",0
"And then, oh, Jamie Lee Curtis just like, no to your no.",1
"I'm like, wow, that's kind of coconut.",0
And then I feel like there's also like coverage of the things that you put out on threads.,1
"Yeah, especially pink news.",0
I literally will like post anything on the web.,0
I'll be like an article about it the next day.,0
"I mean, I'm so curious because like as someone who works like on the internet and like I just do this podcast for a job and whatever like everything happened pretty slowly.",0
Like I've been doing this for like six years and like I've had time to incrementally get used to it.,0
Yeah.,0
"I mean, just a few months ago, you were a very, very private person.",1
Yeah.,0
And all of a sudden you're less so it was.,1
"I mean, I've always been like a pretty, I don't know, ostentatious is the right word was very SATs.",0
"But I've always been like a very kind of like extra person, not necessarily extraverted, more so now, obviously.",0
You kind of have to be.,1
"But I was kind of like overly charismatic, enthusiastic.",0
"I was kind of like, I had a bit of Thordjie Thordjie situation where like, if there was something I liked doing, I was like, wow, you guys were gonna do, I don't know what the fuck that voice was.",1
It was a little toad.,0
"Wow, we're gonna save the castle.",0
I don't know.,0
I'm just curious if it's been overwhelming or how you're dealing with it.,1
"I mean, like it has very much so been overwhelming or how you're dealing with it.",1
"It has very much so been overwhelming, but I am doing everything I can to not be overwhelmed.",0
well and just be welled.,0
"I was also curious, like, what made you decide to not like step into this role?",1
"There's not really a role, but like, spy.",0
"Okay, so the reason I got famous, but those of you don't know, other than the nepotism, the reason the nepotism happened, Jordan Peterson was on a podcast with certain someone.",1
"And obviously that's the fucking thing where the my son, savior, he's dead.",0
"And when Peterson was like, Oh my god.",0
I'm so I don't know why I'm giving the British accent.,0
I thought it's honestly really good.,0
I think it's just way more funny that way.,0
I think you're making Jordan Peterson sound like a little bit nicer than he actually sounds.,1
"I'm making the sound way hotter than he's like, wow, like Jordan Peterson.",0
I can't like you.,1
"No, that's your nasally.",1
Hold on.,0
He has this kind of like overly grovely voice.,0
"Wow, that happened here.",0
Child.,0
Like that's actually accurate.,0
That's like toad and Jordan Peters.,0
What is with the toad voices today?,0
Yeah.,0
But Jordan Peterson was on this patch.,0
voice.,0
"And he was like, Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that your child is dead.",1
"And I was like, just over there in the corner of literally in my small fucking apartment in Tokyo, going to college.",0
"And I was like, did this bitch just try to come for me?",0
"And I was like, no.",0
"Um, no, I was literally like, hell fucking no, I am not about to let this bitch come for me and have that just slide.",0
So I had my little threads response.,0
I didn't weigh in Mega coconuts viral.,0
I keep saying mega coconuts.,0
I stole that from not only one.,0
I'm so sorry I also say coconuts and bananas all the time because I know we win she is like infested Trans vocabulary and gave vocabulary.,0
"Yeah, like infested.",0
It's super mega fucking.,0
It's super mega fucking coconuts,0
So you hear this like dumb podcast?,1
"Yeah, and you're like nope.",1
I want to have a voice in this I literally saw it.,0
I woke up.,0
"I woke I woke up to this is the first thing I experienced that day imagine the sun rising through like, I'm ready for another day.",0
It was a week before finals weeks.,0
"I should have been studying, but I was like, fucking around.",0
"And by fucking around, I mean, rotting in my apartment, watching TikToks and like, vibing.",0
"Then I take my little phone, I open the phone, I see a text from my aunt.",0
I open the text.,0
I love the way you're telling this.,1
Yes.,0
"And she's like, this bitch just tried to come for me.",0
For you.,1
"And I was like, gasp.",0
Double gas this is not how it happened at all.,0
I love that the like telenovelification of this family drama.,0
Exactly.,0
Yeah,0
"No, I love this.",0
I think we should I think everyone should telenovelicize everything.,0
I think it's more fun I mean influence or basically do that.,0
I'm just being honest.,0
I saw the clip and it's Jordan Peterson.,0
She's like he's dead,0
So the first thing I do is I text my mom,0
and I'm like I call that this bitch get to me Mm-hmm.,0
I must retaliate.,0
"I'm so sorry, mother.",0
"I'm going into, I don't know what the fuck this bit is.",0
"I texted my mom, I'm just gonna do normal.",0
voice now.,0
So sorry.,0
"I just my mom like, I'm gonna go public.",0
"So sorry, you can't all stop me.",1
"And at that point, she was kind of just like,",0
"yeah,",0
I trust you do what you need to do.,1
"Obviously, just be careful and whatnot.",0
"And then later on, I take a nap or whatever.",0
And then I wake up,0
and I text my friends.,0
"Obviously, I get like a bunch of texts because this thing went like super fucking viral.",0
I don't think you don't understand.,1
"Um, well, honestly, the people listening to this podcast were paying attention.",0
Yeah.,0
"Uh, the thing went super.",0
for viral,0
and I'm getting like a bunch of texts,0
and I text my friends that I'm gonna go public and my friend was just think I was like kind of used to that especially after the book camp there was a book came out they should talk to me whatever it's fine fuck you Walter Isaacson,1
yeah fuck you Walter Isaacson that was direct and my friend also I think everyone has one friend where they get because like I'm used to this shit she wasn wasn't.,1
She was so much angrier than I was about the whole situation because I was like no one worried to it,0
and I was like I'm gonna going public,0
"and she was like,",0
"oh my God, bitch, fuck.",0
"Yes, I'm so excited for you.",1
You better eat him alive.,1
"And I was like, I'll do my best.",0
And then I did my best.,0
And then Jamie Lee Curtis followed me.,0
That's the story of how it happened.,0
"Prior to that, I mean, you had always lived a private life.",1
"I mean, yeah, pretty much.",0
I had no socials.,0
"My social girl, like, private.",0
"I mean, it feels like the privacy was almost kind of taken from you.",1
I don't know if it was necessarily taken from me because I chose to respond.,0
"And when I chose to respond, I knew what I was going to get to.",0
And even then I could have done the threads post and then disappeared back into the wind,0
and I didn't.,0
Yeah.,0
That's my choice.,0
So I'm not going to say it was taken from me.,0
"It was, I was given a choice",0
and I chose.,0
You said a second ago to me that your response actually went more viral than the initial podcast live.,1
"And how, how was that?",0
"Uh, validating.",0
Yeah.,0
Very valid.,0
"That was the moment I realized, Oh, fuck, I actually I actually do have a voice.",0
Yeah.,0
"Because before that, I kind of was just like, I felt so powerless.",0
"Also, I had all this like pent up emotion, obviously from childhood and life and whatever.",0
And it was literally probably the most cathartic moment of my entire life doing that.,0
"That's really amazing to hear because I feel like, I would imagine it could have been like super overwhelming and it probably was, but it was like a net was like it was but it was also like very exciting.",0
It was like a whole new world.,0
It was very Jasmine.,0
Did you anticipate the level of support?,1
"Honestly, no, I thought it would be there would be a lot more backlash than there was.",0
"Obviously, the conservatives hate me, but I don't know what they think.",0
"So, girl, it's easy to compartmentalize when conservatives hate you, I feel like.",1
"Like for me, it's like, I want you to get called a fag at once.",1
Like you've gotten called a fag at a thousand times.,1
"Once you get called an HGP once, once you get called an HSTS brick hunt or whatever the fuck.",1
This is like crazy for channeling up that I had to my ex had to explain to me what an age Gp brick on was I have literally no idea and an HSTS password because so people were calling me these things,0
and I was like I have no like she told me that people were calling me this I was like I looked at her.,0
I'm like what the fuck does that mean?,0
"Okay, so apparently here's a thing.",0
"I knew what password was I did not know what any of the other ones Passaway is like the most fortune-tun imatual as you knowchan has the LGBT board, the TTT1, TTTTT, and what it is, it's a bunch of like lonely conservative trans fems in the closet who find the most obnoxious possible way to talk about literally everything regarding the trans experience.",1
"They call people who pass, passoids as a derogatory term.",0
"They're like also fortune is like obsessed with passing like kind of the entire transgender is obsessed with passing because it's like a reasonable thing to be obsessed about, especially when safety is in the picture.",0
"But, um, but I feel like it's when the when a slurred that someone calls you is so like rooted in terminally online culture that you don't even know what they're calling you.",1
"It's like, that's kind of the read in and of itself.",0
"Yeah, it's like you think you ate that, but the only thing you ate was your cell.",1
"No, that's quite the",0
yeah.,0
"Yeah, the only thing you ate was yourself.",1
Were you ever scared of to make your voice so public?,1
Oh yeah.,0
I was definitely scared.,0
But like you got to your point where it's like I don't really have anything to lose.,1
I had been drugged so far through the mud,0
and I was used as like an example of why trans kids should not exist basically,0
"and I was like Literally at this point there's nowhere to go but up because I was used as that scapegoat for so long like in the book and I keep calling it the book in the biography in conservative culture in general whenever anyone would talk about me because for those who don't know I got my uh document, my name change core documents leaked in 2022.",0
"Again, they use that as another example of like, how I'm like, I don't know, fucking bunkers.",0
Which I am fucking bunkers.,0
But not in that way.,0
Just not in the way that they accuse you of being.,1
Exactly.,0
"Just a quick break from the episode to thank the sponsor of today's episode, Factor.",0
"Lately, between making this podcast and doing live shows for this podcast, which I'm currently touring around for, and making stuff for social media, and trying to sneak in a little bit. bit of extra time just to take care of myself.",0
I honestly haven't had that much time for anything else.,0

So you just celebrated five years of coming out?,1
I did!,0
I came out.,0
Congratulations!,0
I came out May 5th 2020.,0
I think it was May 5th or 6th.,0
I don't remember which one.,0
Happy 5th.,0
Happy five.,0
Thank you.,1
What was your like coming out like?,1
Okay.,0
It was the cringes coming out.,0
I think I've that's I've ever heard of in history.,0
"Like I posted to my story one of those, you know, like extreme close up, like I call them like crack shots of like your face.",1
Okay.,0
"For like the memes, kind of like the point five thing, but it was like, sure, sure, sure.",0
It was literally just like a close up of like my face making like a funny face being cringy and shit and I had it,0
Hi everyone.,0
I'm trans,0
she her pronouns.,0
And then the bottom left.,0
"I was like, because I didn't want to make it a whole thing.",0
And I wanted someone I wanted people to be able to talk to me about something other than that.,0
"So maybe if I mentioned something else, they would grasp onto that and then the conversation would be less awkward.",0
My dumb ass thought that less awkward meant talking about the hunger games.,0
"Okay, so I also said, are you team Pina or Okay, so I also said are you team Peter or Like I was what I just 16.",1
"Okay, give me a fucking break.",0
Like I'm transgender.,0
What does everyone think about the hunger games?,0
Yeah.,0
Maybe I am.,0
I was.,0
I love the strategy there.,0
"I wish I could have been in your 16 year old brain at the point in which you were strategizing, like, how do I make my coming out less about coming out and more about, like, Peter?",1
"I was like, how do I how do I destroy my social reputation?",0
"Even I mean, I didn't obviously being trans was relatively fine.",0
It was Los Angeles.,0
Okay.,0
Like you grew up.,1
I grew up in LA.,0
"Yeah, I knew that.",0
I'm from LA.,0
"But I was like, how do I make everyone think I'm even more of a nerdy shut-in than everyone already does?",0
"No, I was like not popular at all in high school.",0
I liked very much.,0
I kept it myself.,0
I was that girl.,0
Yeah.,0
And how was coming out?,0
It was cool.,0
"I posted on my sister's story and then people were like, okay.",0
"And then, yeah. Was it like fine in your personal life like until the media came along other than the obvious",1
yes,0
yeah,0
yeah,0
Yeah.,0
"I mean, like there was some struggle.",0
"There were some people who struggled to get used to it, but like whatever.",0
"You, you brought up something about like being basically like turned into a pawn where it's like when conservatives want to talk about trans people, they talk about you.",1
It was definitely one of the pawns that they used when they wanted to talk about like why trans kids or like brainwasher or whatever the fuck because of the woke mind virus.,0
Love the woke mind virus.,0
I love the woke mind virus.,0
It's a real virus.,0
"It's among my favorite viruses among our favorite virus, but something that I think so much about and that we get to touch on sometimes on this podcast is The way that like we as culture from sort of all sides politically turn people like human beings into Ponds into symbols of bigger conversations that like may or may not really have anything to do with them",0
"Yeah, and like I think about it, I mean, I always find ways to talk about Britney Spears, but we really, we continue to do this with Britney Spears.",0
"I mean, 20 years ago, we did it with Britney Spears regarding like, we wanted to talk about conversations of like young womanhood and sexuality, and we would project all of those complicated things onto Britney Spears, who was like an 18 year old woman.",0
Yeah.,0
And now we talk about like mental health and disability rights through the body of Britney Spears.,0
Britney Spears for tangent over.,0
I just have to slip it in there.,0
"I also think about that in the context of like another thing that I've talked about a lot on this podcast, like the Dylan Mulvaney Bud Light.",0
"Oh my God, I feel so bad.",0
I felt so bad for her.,0
Yeah.,0
"Okay, I'm not gonna lie.",0
That was one of the things that fucking horrified me about like potentially becoming famous is I saw that.,0
"And literally like the first week of, like the first few weeks of becoming famous, I was the only thing I could think of was like, that could be me someday.",0
Like are they gonna Dylan Mulvaney me?,0
"Yeah, pretty much.",0
"And I was like, well, I was the only thing I could think of was like, that could be me someday.",0
"Like, are they going to deal in Mulvaney me?",0
"Yeah, pretty much.",0
"And I was like, well, I'm pretty high up on the list of trans people who conservatives don't like, I'm thinking at least in the top 10.",0
"So I'm like, fuck, that might happen to me one day.",0
But you don't feel like it has?,1
Not yet.,0
I don't feel like it has.,0
It's cool.,0
And it's pretty like fascinating how you're able to because obviously people have said crazy shit.,1
"Yeah, it seems like you're able to compartmentalize it really well.",1
"Yeah, you just push it deep deep down.",1
But I will say there's one thing I want to talk about.,0
The hate comments when conservative call me like a trainee analyze it really well.,0
say that right.,0
Of course.,0
"When they call me a try and she mail in a packet and other service and I'm like, okay, whatever, whatever, I don't care.",0
"But then when I like a leftist says I saw like a leftist saying like I find her obnoxious, I want to actually kind of hurt because they're like, I value I value your opinion.",1
"Girl, and I am obnoxious.",0
But you don't need to call me back.,1
"Oh my gosh, I would love to just like talk about like dealing with different types of hate comments because it's so I feel like we were talking about it's like once you've been called a faggot or some slur once by a conservative.",1
It's like it doesn't hit anymore.,0
"No, it doesn't it's like",0
oh you're like I know how that feels tick and like these people of course they hate me,1
"It's like who cares yeah,",0
but when you get it from people who you think are on your own like it hurts a lot more and it might be like a way less or insult,1
"yeah,",0
but it's from someone who you think should like you,1
yeah,0
I don't know that's my experience.,0
That's my experience as well.,0
Now that's very true.,0
I remember I used to talk to my therapist about that.,0
"I was like, but They're on my side.",0
They're on my side and they're like making TikToks about me or whatever.,0
"And she was like, but if they're talking about you that way, then maybe they're not really like as on your side as you think they are.",1
Yeah.,0
"There's always gonna be someone like, who doesn't like you.",1
"And I did see a stage talk about me by someone who was like, I don't think we should trust her because they're like, is she doing like a side-off?",0
Is this like all fake?,0
"And I'm like, bitch, I did not lose like down to my fucking health insurance.",0
and sell plan just to be like a fake training on the Internet.,0
"Like, what the fuck are you talking about?",1
"Like, I don't know.",0
"People are also I mean, people are so so many people are just desperate to like have a conspiracy about the world.",0
But you know what I mean?,1
"Yeah, no, I'm like, I think there is actually like a lot less conspiracy than people think, which is kind of like a boring answer.",0
"But like, it's kind of I feel like a lot of things are less intentional than people think, but we'll see.",0
I don't know.,0
Maybe the moon landing was.,0
"Okay, we're keeping an open mind done with lasers or whatever the fuck They had quite in Tarentee Jewish Jewish faces Jewish space lasers.",0
That's my taste.,0
"Yeah,",0
but I'm Jewish,0
"Oh,",0
"oh my god, they're gonna clip that and be like, oh god.",0
Oh god.,0
I do it to myself,0
I do it to myself.,0
I cannot actually believe the moon liner was made for the fucking record.,0
"Thank you very much I am yeah, and I don't believe the space lasers were Jewish.",1
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha,0
"Who made the space lasers, Matt?",0
Who made them?,0
The Italians.,0
Are you Italian?,1
Nope.,0
"Sorry, you are funding a group.",1
That was some strong anti-Italian X sentiment on the UBIT Fruity podcast.,0
Sorry.,0
But people being turned into symbols.,0
Mm-hmm.,0
"Like I said, it's something I think about.",0
"Sorry, I'm gonna say like, people being turned into symbols.",0
Like... Are they being turned into symbols?,0
People being turned into symbols.,0
But they're being turned...,0
Are they?,0
"Are they being turned into symbols or not, Matt?",0
People being turned into symbols?,0
People being turned into symbols.,0
But they're being turned into... are they?,0
Are they being turned into symbols or not?,0
Matt.,0
People being turned into symbols.,0
People being turned into symbols.,0
What symbols are they being turned into?,0
OK.,0
This is the recording process.,0
There's always that.,0
Did you know something people being turned into symbols?,1
People are being turned into symbols.,0
"The symbols mama, they're being turned into.",0
"Speaking of people being turned into symbols, it kind of I feel like happens from every direction.",0
"And you, I was going through your threads account when I was writing down some notes that I wanted to bring up when I got to talk to you.",1
Is this from my angsty early famous posting days?,0
How early was a month ago?,0
I'm being exposed.,0
I really was a month ago.,0
You shady bitch.,1
You wrote something that I thought was really interesting.,1
You basically wrote that people like on the left were referring to you as some sort of like Katniss Everdeen heroic rebel figure.,1
"And so what I find interesting about the like kind of reducing people into like these ponds and culture wars and stuff is that you know, people who hate you will turn you into like a cartoon villain.",1
Yeah.,0
And then the people who are kind of claiming you for their side will turn you into like a cartoon martyr.,1
"Yeah, no, it's kind of crazy because like other ways just you're being I don't know, straw man is the right word, but you're being like exaggerated.",1
And there's a sense of connecting dots that don't exist in order to like fulfill this narrative.,0
This is just a lot of connecting dots that don't exist in order to like fulfill this narrative.,0
This is just a lot of fucking buzzwords.,0
"Okay, you're kind of just turned into a into like a straw man on either side, which is not great.",1
"Plus the martyrs' shade is really weird because I'm like, I'm still alive.",0
Why are you turning me into a martyr?,1
I don't get that.,0
That's like something I did not expect.,0
But it's definitely something I've seen.,0
"It's like at the heart of all these conversations that are so much bigger than you, it's just like this like 21 year old person.",1
"Yeah, I'm just like a 21 year old bitchy nerd.",0
"What do you want now that you're being out and public and all that, like what do you want people to know from you, like the person, not you, the symbol?",1
"Uh, what I want.",0
"people to know about me is under the insane, genuinely insane amount of random cultural references that I make and other subnoxiousness and Rapunzel hair.",0
I'm just a human being with a soul.,0
I'm just kidding.,0
I got my soul surgery removed.,0
That's that.,0
That's the gender surgery they've been talking about.,0
It's the soul removal.,0
They demurefy your soul.,1
Sure.,0
Yeah.,0
"They take your soul, they make it more demure, and then they give it back to you.",1
"In my case, it turned out it was a scam.",0
"Oh, sure.",0
So they just took it and they never gave it back.,0
Okay.,0
I'm gonna pull another post of yours,1
"Oh, wow, you posted on threads that people should stop shipping you with Baron Trump There is an a03 fan fiction Featuring being Baron Trump.",1
That is so I think it was after I made the post.,0
"I'm not sure I'd have to check the dates I am sure you've seen a lot of crazy shit about yourself, but I'm specifically so sorry about that one That one is really funny though.",1
Don't do it,0
but it is funny.,0
Not happening.,0
Absolutely not.,0
What is it?,0
I think never.,0
Is he a swank?,0
"He's like 6'4"".",0
"Baron Trump is, can you be like a, I don't know, like a fascist child and a twink?",1
Maybe.,0
Yes.,0
Mylenaupolus. Mylenaupolus.,0
He is a fascist child twink.,0
What is some of the craziest like shit that you've seen about yourself?,1
Okay.,0
I've seen some really funny shit.,0
"The funniest one I think I've seen, I've posted this on threads was someone attributed my lore, I'm just going to call it my lore because so I don't have to go into depth every single time.",0
Sure.,0
Someone attributed my lore.,0
"to my astrological sign to explain my behavior in like a critical way, because they were conservative, but they also got the astrological sign wrong, because they got my wrong birthday.",0
"What, they were like she's trans because of her sign?",0
Yeah.,0
What sign are you?,1
I'm an Aries.,0
"Okay, an Aries.",0
"I think they got the Aries part right, but Aries part right, but they attributed it to my rising.",0
Okay.,0
And it was a different rising.,0
Okay.,0
"I think my rising is Aries or Cancer, but they attributed it to my rising.",0
Okay.,0
And it was a different rising.,0
Okay.,0
I think my rising is Aries or Cancer.,0
So they said like.,0
Horoscopes are making people train.,0
now.,0
I wish.,0
That's like the funniest thing I've ever seen.,0
That was like the funniest thing I've ever gone.,0
Do you ever feel like you're just like hallucinating when you see like just stupid shit about yourself?,1
"Yes, all the time.",0
"And like, like these people live in the twilight zone.",0
"Yeah, I see a lot of people who like go out of their way to make fake accounts of me.",0
"I'm like, Oh, am I that interesting?",0
Like a lot of conservatives also.,0
"I've seen a lot of people go on Twitter, try to make an account under like my name and use one of my pictures for their profile thing and say, the media has it all wrong.",0
I love that.,0
And it's obviously no way I would never type.,0
"And usually it's chat, GPT or some shit.",0
But it's the most wild shit I've ever seen.,0
"Are they like, I'm a cis girl?",0
I'm actually a cis girl and everything's fine?,0
"No, they don't think I'm a cis.",0
"Obviously my transition is documented, so they can't say I'm a cis girl.",0
"They were like, I'm like, sorry, I made a mistake.",0
And I made no mistakes.,0
I made zero mistakes and I have zero remorse.,0
This would not be an episode of A Bit Fruity.,0
I did not give some lashings to conservative LGBT people.,0
"Oh God, let's go at it.",0
The first episode I ever did of this podcast was actually,0
Who was she talking?,0
"It was, you're about to find out.",1
I have a guess.,0
Who's your guess?,1
"My guess is Kaylin Conrad just made a story about Breonna Wu, so is it Breonna Wu?",0
It's not Breonna Wu.,0
"Oh, who is it?",0
"The first episode of this podcast that I ever did was with Natalie Wynn, who we both love.",0
I love her.,0
And it was about LGBT conservatives.,0
And yeah.,0
"as I was scrolling some things that you've posted, you gave some very, I think, well deserved lashings to trans conservative YouTuber Blair White.",1
"Oh, which messy.",0
"I mean, I'm not being messy.",0
She came for me first.,0
What did she say?,0
She was like in twenty twenty two when the only thing that was public about me was the court document that was released and what was said about me in the book.,0
That was all anyone knew about me.,0
"And she attributed the fact that I was trans to to the fact that my high school had a cross-dressing day, which was news to me.",0
"And I had, because I was like, I had literally never heard of this or remembered it.",0
Like maybe it happened that I just wasn't paying attention and was absent that day.,0
Sounds fabulous.,0
But apparently they stopped it the year before I entered the school.,0
So never even happened.,0
And that's not how people become trans.,0
And she knows that.,0
Why do you think someone like Blair White is so desperate?,1
Yeah.,0
She makes a fuck ton of money.,0
and sponsorships and like YouTube ads.,0
"I keep fucking with the table, I'm sorry.",0
It's okay.,0
It's money.,0
"Correct, and like attention.",0
I do think she genuinely believes what she says though.,0
You do.,1
Maybe like a slightly less exaggerated version.,0
"But like, I mean, I know there are a bunch of like hosts of like Fox News that are like apparently liberal and they say it's allegedly, which I'm not sure if I believe.",0
"Yeah, I mean, my take with that kind of stuff is it's like, it actually doesn't even matter If they really believe it or not it doesn't what matters is what they say is the result of the problem Exactly the product they put out in the world and like whether or not you go home and you're like I'm actually nice Behind the scenes.",1
It's like doesn't matter because you're not nice in front of the scene,1
"Yeah, cuz regardless of what they actually think the product is the product and the product is working as intended What can Blair white?",0
She is so interesting to me.,0
"I mean, she's not that interesting because like you said It's like once you're making money from that sort of speech.",1
"It's like, okay",0
"Well, you're just gonna do it as long as it's making money.",1
She's gone progressively further right as she's gonna go.,0
"So fuck you, Black White.",1
I want to get that out there.,0
Yeah.,0
"Yeah, I fuck where wait Fuck LGBT conservatives.",0
"It's it's a fixation that I have because I'm just like how how I and like you said It's like once they're making money from it, but they're like LGBT conservatives who are also like not making money That's the thing",1
and I'm like There's such as you know so much self-hatred again.,1
He's like delusion.,0
They genuinely think that these people actually tolerate them.,0
That's why they don't pay.,0
I think it is a lot of delusion.,0
"And it's like this optimism about like, no, I'm one of the good ones.",0
"I promise I'm one of the good ones, but they'll never see you that way.",1
"There's like a desperation from validation because like if someone says, Natalie when actually talked about this, if someone says something negative about you, you might be more inclined to believe it's true.",1
And conservatives say negative shit about the gays and the trannies all the time.,0
I literally just said trannies.,0
The gays and the trans people all the time.,0
The gays and the trannies.,0
"You can say it, all the time.",1
The gaze and the tra- the gaze-,0
"You can say it, I can't.",1
The gaze!,0
It's your microphone.,1
It's your microphone.,1
I'm really good point.,0
"Okay, I don't want to be accidentally, people are mad at me that I say the word trainings a lot.",0
"But I mean, I think it's really funny.",0
That is not my cross to the right.,0
Also says trend.,0
Does she?,0
"I think probably, but she probably means it negatively.",0
"If someone says something negative about you, especially in regards to your trans identity, because obviously, especially when starting out, you're kind of desperate for anyone to perceive you as what you perceive yourself as.",1
"And you might be going to like really negative places and going to depths that you shouldn't be going to in search for validation, even if it's It's fake.",1
And I think that might be kind of where some LGBT conservators are at.,0
"Obviously, I'm not one",0
and I'm not like a psychologist or anything.,0
So it's not really correct of me to psychoanalyze an entire group of people.,0
"But like, I don't know, maybe that has something to do with something.",0
A quick break from the episode to give a shout out to Blue Land.,0
"Blue Land was the first sponsor this podcast ever had when it was hardly even a podcast, and we are still going strong, so I haven't pissed them off too much.",0
yet.,0
I like for my apartment to look nice.,0
"Moreover, I like the things that I use to make my apartment look nice to look nice.",0
"When you live in New York City, you get used to living in very small spaces and it gets very easy for clutter to make itself very known.",1
"And bottles of cleaning supplies laying around everywhere with frankly frankly, garish neon tones.",0
Kind of an eyesore.,0
At least for me.,0
At least for me.,0
I care a lot about my eyes.,0
"about what my home looks like all the time, and I'm a stickler about these things.",0
Blue Land is a line of sustainable home cleaning products on a mission to eliminate single use plastic by reinventing cleaning essentials that are better for you and the planet.,1
"And they look really great, which I know is not really the point.",0
But they do!,0
"All you do with Blue Land is buy one of their forever bottles, beautifully and functionally designed, you fill it with water and you pop in a tablet of whatever cleaning solution you bought, whether that's mirror cleaner, multi-purpose cleaner, hand soap, you name it, and you're And when you run out of your cleaning solution, all you have to do is pop in a refill tablet, fill the bottle back up with water, and you're ready to go again.",1
And those refill tablets start for as low as $2.25.,0
"So not only better on the planet, but easier on your wallet.",1
If you'd like to try Blue Land as always and now.,1
Let's get back to the episode.,0
You know what?,1
I'm going to say this.,0
I want to be I'm going to be conci.,0
"Jordan Peterson, thank you for making me famous.",1
That was good.,0
"Yeah, that was really good.",0
"I bet you didn't expect that turn of events, bitch.",1
Fucking lobster bait.,0
Stop trying to fuck the lobsters.,0
They're not interesting.,0
They're not.,0
That's good.,0
Just because your face is red isn't it?,1
not mean you should fuck something that is red.,1
She's got jokes.,0
Yeah.,0
Back to it looks like his parents got fucked by a lobster.,0
Is it Jordan Peterson rose?,0
Tell me what else.,1
The floor is yours.,1
"You know, it makes sense that he's obsessed with hierarchies because I bet in bed he likes to be at the bottom of one.",1
"Oh, yeah.",0
"No, I know.",0
Fucking canceled.,0
Cuz I bet in bed he likes to be at the bottom of one.,0
"Oh, yeah.",0
I'm calling him a suicide.,0
"No, I know it's good.",0
Fucking castle.,0
"I mean, everyone listening to this podcast, here's a here's a fun activity.",0
"If you're listening to this podcast right now on Spotify, where there's now a comment section or YouTube.",1
Spotify has a comment section.,0
Yeah.,0
Give us your.,1
I feel like that's a horrible idea.,0
"Probably, but not for this episode, because if you're listening to this, I want you to give us your most creative Jordan B. Peterson lashing.",1
You like jazz?,1
I feel like he's someone who would pretend to like jazz.,0
I feel like the social esteem.,0
"Yeah, because he's like, I'm a real conservative because like it's like we like.",0
music.,0
"Yeah, yeah.",0
Yeah.,0
I feel like he's one of those people who like super like listen to like my style.,0
You are 21 years old.,1
Uh huh.,0
"Not to do the like, you know, I will just say before we started recording Vivian called me an elder gay.",1
I did not.,0
I did not call you an elder gay.,1
I said you had like the aura of an elder gay.,1
You're not actually an elder gay.,1
You're 26.,1
"I am 26, but you know what?",1
You know who's an elder gay?,1
"Jordan B. Beaver, you're dead.",1
She's quick.,0
She's quick.,0
She's witty.,0
She's sharp.,0
You know what?,1
I think it's good to be called an elder.,0
It's going to happen at some point.,0
Every gay talks about this.,0
At some point you get called an elder gay.,1
It's a band day that needs to be ripped off and I am happy for you to be banded off.,1
You're 26.,1
I'm 26.,0
You have a while before that band day gets ripped off though.,1
"Well, okay.",0
"So speaking of, you have even longer ahead of you.",1
I'm not a gay man.,0
"Well, no, that's not what I mean.",0
I do not have to experience Twitter.,0
I want to look like Meryl Streep in the Dill Force product.,0
Like that's my goal.,0
"As a 21 year old, I don't want to be like, what's next for you?",1
But you have literally your life out of you.,1
"Not to sound like a cliche, but whatever I want to do next.",0
"I really, really enjoy modeling specifically.",0
"I've been doing some photography modeling and I would just sound vague and to say like I enjoy modeling, but I do.",0
It's really fun.,0
I really like how you can get like really creative with like the posing,1
and I struggle sometimes with like serving the correct amount of face,0
But it's like something that I've really been working on trying to improve,0
and I really really enjoy modeling,0
And I don't want to sound vain.,0
It doesn't sound vain really fucking good at it.,0
"Yeah, you are we saw the Teen Vogue cover",1
"Oh, honey.",0
"Yeah, I haven't seen shit yet Period",0
"I'm like I've seen the photos for I don't like no eight eight that are the lesbians are gonna get the photos for out of like, oh, the lesbians are gonna get it.",0
And the gays are gonna get it.,0
"And the barges, and the trans, and maybe some heterosexuals.",0
Come once you know who I am.,1
"That's like kind of extracurricular, though.",0
"Yeah, exactly.",0
We don't really care what they think.,0
Sorry.,0
But we care what many more of this is thanks.,0
What were you studying in Japan?,1
I was studying Japanese language.,0
I wanted to be an English teacher or a translator.,0
Do you still see that somewhere in your future or your pain?,1
"I don't know if obviously I don't think that was going to last forever, but like I'm using this opportunity to explore different.",0
I sound like a fucking pageant queen again.,0
I'm using this opportunity to explore different career paths.,0
that might not have been open to me otherwise and see what I enjoy what I don't enjoy,0
and then obviously I still intend on getting a degree if it's in the same thing we'll see,0
but like if fame dies down then I will continue on the path because I love languages and if it doesn't I'm going to be just vibing.,0
Professionally Vivian?,0
"Yeah, professionally Vivian.",0
"Well, like, um, this is like something that happens to very few people.",0
And I'm very fortunate to be able to get to experience something like this in this life.,0
"So I'm like, I should take advantage of this and see if it's something that I want to take even more advantage of because I really enjoy modeling.",0
And that's something that might not have been open to me otherwise.,0
"I mean, probably open, but not like sustainable, right?",0
Sure.,0
"I actually got off the plane in New York in the first thing someone did was like, hand me a little card being like do you have an agent?",1
Do you have a modeling agent?,1
"I was like, this is correct.",0
"And if you are a casting director who happens to be listening to this podcast, hi, I'm Vivian.",1
"I body is too, you just can't see it right now because I'm draped in black.",1
And the hair and the face.,0
The hair you can't see.,1
Hold on.,0
You got everything going on.,1
"If you are, if you work for Panteen and you're listening to this podcast, look at the material.",1
"Hi, look at the material.",0
Look at the fucking material.,1
It's organic.,0
"This is a big question maybe but you know obviously the climate for LGBT people for trans people specifically is, you know, I don't need to tell you what it is because we're all living through it.",1
Hello.,0
And this is kind of corny.,0
But do you have like a message for trans people now that you're out and have this like kind of huge microphone?,1
Just okay.,0
"Tim when Tim Vogue asked me this basically some exact question, I quite a conger point, so I didn't realize it's putting a movie that I had never heard of.",0
"So to me, it's a quote from scratch voice, which is like, stay strong sister, don't let the bastards get you down.",1
"Which to me, what that means is like, be confident in yourself and who you are and don't let other people's perception of who you are affect your own perception of who you are because you are valid and you are that bitch if you want to be that bitch.",1
Here you are.,1
If you don't want to be that bitch.,1
Then you don't have to be that.,1
You don't have to be.,1
"Yeah, yeah.",0
"But like don't let other people's perceptions of you affect what you think of who you are, or affect your own perception of who you are.",1
That's my message.,0
I feel like you have so much authority in Telling people to not let the bastards get them down because the bastards have certainly tried to get you down,1
They did not succeed.,0
They only contributed to my rise Period Does it feel a little like quick to have that title thrust upon you?,1
"Yeah, I was 21 years old.",0
That's how I felt when you called me a gay elder.,1
"I was like, I called you the spirit of a gay elder.",1
And I'll bet you actually were one.,1
"Thank you very well, you're the spirit of a trans icon.",1
So even I hear the spirit of a trans icon.,0
What is your impression of my voice?,1
My squeaky little boy.,0
"No, your voice is lower than mine.",1
Yeah.,0
"OK, to wrap it up, I have a couple pop culture questions.",0
"Oh, shoot.",0
OK.,0
Are you ready?,1
"OK, absolutely.",0
Are you do you listen to pop music?,1
"Yeah, what is your favorite album out recently?",1
I don't know.,0
I should have a,0
"You know how the honestly was like I just don't release albums anymore I never paid attention to I am part of the problem because I never actually paid attention to what was on what album Okay, fair enough.",1
What music are you listening to a lot of k-pop and a lot of like pop-pop?,1
Have you been following the the black pink solo releases?,1
Oh girl.,0
I love Jenny.,0
The thing she does is out on camera right now.,0

There's a video of black things saying the n-word all three of them except for Jisoo I love Jisoo,0
She's my favorite from Blackpink.,0
You're done.,1
"She actually was my favorite from Blackpink, so that hasn't changed.",0
"Well, and she did release a really good single, Earthquake, that I was listening to.",0
I haven't heard that one.,0
I love Flower.,0
Flower is my favorite.,0
I love The Facing Bitch.,0
Flower is my favorite song.,0
"Okay, speaking of pop music, thoughts on Katy Perry going to space?",0
"Okay, some of this podcast has been heavy.",0
I want to lighten it up a little bit.,0
"My thoughts on Katy Perry going to space, it's, you know, it's a woman's world, right?",1
Mm-hmm and it kept spinning regardless as to whether or not she was on for five minutes.,0
Mm-hmm,0
and then she came back.,0
Yeah unfortunately Fucking brutal Katie Perry is like a,0
"and I don't say this with spite, but she's a deeply like millennial figure the most",0
"she's like You know, it's very um, you know, I was little",1
I like I just did a thing.,0
"I thought Roy came out in 1999 You know, I was a little",1
I just did a thing.,0
I thought Roy came out in 1999.,0
I didn't realize it's 2013.,0
"OK, now you're making me feel like a gay elder.",1
"You're like five years older than me, calm down.",1
"Yeah,",0
but we're actually born in 1999.,0
I was born in 98.,0
I was born in 2004.,0
You thought Roar came out in 1999.,1
Yeah.,0

I was never I'm so threat,0
I'm so thrilled.,0
I'm so thrilled on the day of our recording this,0
"it is the premiere of all stars 10 Yes, who are you rooting for to go all the way?",1
There's a thing I have multiple of their numbers.,0
"So if I say somewhat in particular, the others are going to be mad.",0
I don't know if they care that much.,0
"I feel like the politically correct answer for me to say is I am rooting for all my dolls, all the dolls, all the trans representation on the season.",0
"Aja, Bosco, Carrie, Colby, there's so much talent on the season.",0
"And there's so many iconic figures, not only from Drag Race itself, but also just in pop culture in general, especially what they've done outside of the show.",0
Mistress has really exceeded outside of the show.,0
Aja has become such a huge name in ballroom.,0
"And it's just like, really, it warms my heart to see our I raised girls killing it.",0
The dolls.,0
"Yeah, the dolls.",0
Mistress is not trans.,0

It's a new one.,0
They're transvestigating the pope?,0
"They literally were like, he, I mean, she is a trans man.",0
"And I'm like, baby, I want whatever you're smoking.",1
No way.,0
Yeah.,0
You can't even be the pope anymore without being transvestitated.,1
People have to.,0
that's what you did me.,1
And I'm obviously a Demirisys woman on the topic of like hate comments that we received.,0
One of the most memorable ones was my very first TikTok.,0
I did this like kick onto a table because I thought I was like so kind of like failing at you go like 20 million views on Twitter.,1
Thank you to whatever conservative posted that on Twitter with my dead name because you basically made my TikTok career.,1
So we stay winning regardless.,0
"It was like kicking my leg up onto the table being like, I'm not just a bitch, I'm a bitch with a backstory.",0
"And someone froze the frame or my leg, was the highest in the air and then circled a line of fabric that they thought was my dick and said I found it.",0
What the fuck?,0
Yeah.,0
What the fuck?,0
Yeah.,0
In rad too.,0
It was very YouTuber.,0
Jesus Christ.,0

I don't give a fuck.,0
Yeah.,0
I thought it was so funny.,0
That is fucking funny.,0
I live.,0
And people are psychopaths.,0
It wasn't my dick.,0
I mean they thought my it was so funny.,0
"Like because I don't think they realized how tall I was they the thing in the red circle that was like a line of fabric I think was like 12 inches Baby, no people are fucking crazy.",0
"Yeah, can I end on sort of a cheesy pageant question?",0
Yes,0
Given everything Personally politically nationally.,0
"Yeah, what is something that's giving you hope and joy right now?",1
The symbol.,0
Fuck off.,0
"What's giving me joy is because I own Trans Icon and when I am crowned to Trans Icon, I will find art for world peace.",0
"Okay, I just stopped just referencing all the brain rot that this podcast has given me.",0

"Vivian Jenimalsen, thank you for... being here on the Abit Pretty podcast.",1
Thank you for having me on the Abit,1
Pretty podcast.,0
"Before we go, where can people find you and where can people hire you?",1
I'm distracted by the fact that you're opposing like a flamingo.,1
"Okay, you know what?",1
You sit in these chairs for long enough,1
and it gets weird.,0
"No, it's very like...",0
It hurts every bone.,0
Where can it be?,0
Every bone.,0
It was deafening.,0
I heard every single thing in your knee just pop. bone.,1

Honorary judges and members of the esteemed panel.,0
"This is Vivian Wilson, hailing from the Golden State of California.",0
clever.,0
Do you want to give a pageant goodbye to the camera?,1
your time.,1
That was really fucking impressive.,0
"Yeah, it only should be like eight tries.",0
And that was my morning conversation with Vivian Jenna Wilson.,0
It is a hard time to be a 21 year old girl.,0
It is a hard time to be transgender.,0
It is I imagine a hard time to have that person be your father.,1
And it was just a real joy getting to know Vivian.,0
"Vivian, not as a pawn in a culture war or a conversation that is about so much more than her, but just as her, a 21 year old person.",0
I hope you enjoyed getting to sit down with her as much as I did.,1
"I hope you don't mind that this week we took a break from all of the hardcore internet analysis deep dives to just talk to someone who so often gets spoken for, especially by people who don't have her best interest at heart, and just give her the mic speak for herself.",1
I love you so much.,1
"Thanks for listening today and until next time, stay fruity.",0
