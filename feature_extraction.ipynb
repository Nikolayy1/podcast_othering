You may have noticed that. But even by that unchanging standard, Gina Chrono has had a pretty remarkable life packed into a relatively short amount of time. So in 2006, she began as a professional mixed martial arts fighter. In a few years she was starring in big Hollywood films like Fast and Furious. Then in 2019, not that long ago, she got one of the biggest roles for her career. She was on a Disney show called The Mandalorian. In case you didn\\'t see it, here she is. Stay back, dropper. Easy. Drop your weapon. You\\'re gonna wish you never left Alderaan. I saw your planet destroyed. I was on the Death Star. So So back in 2019 when you worked at Disney... Disney, the Disney Corporation, you could expect a long and pretty stable career. It\\'s a huge company, lots of things you could keep doing there at a pretty good salary. And the only cost would be you have to follow the rules. Disney at the time was getting increasingly political and the people who worked there were expected to go along with this. So don\\'t say anything and you\\'ll be absolutely fine. But for some reason, she could not follow that rule. And so she went on Twitter and pushed back on some of the things that Disney was pushing. She questioned the most of Black Lives Matter. If it\\'s so great, why isn\\'t it helping Black people? She asked about the 2020 election. Was it really fair? And then she suggested that maybe Vax mandates were not a good idea. So what do you think happened? Well, Disney fired her. What happened next to Gina Chrono? It\\'s an even more interesting story than the first part of her life. And so we\\'re honored to have her join us on set now. Gina, thanks so much. Thank you, Tucker. It\\'s so good to see you again. It\\'s great to see you. So last we spoke, and I don\\'t know because both of our lives have taken lots of turn since then. I can\\'t remember how long it\\'s been, but you were just kind of emerging from the chaos of getting fired for things that in a normal country would not cause you to be fired, like refusing to put in a pretty funny way your pronouns in your email and they fired you. So what happened now? Like what are the twists that your life has taken since? Because I think it tells us a lot. Well, we went to the Daily Wire. after the cancellation. Daily Wire in Nashville. Yes, and why\\'d you go there? What was your expectation? Because Ben Shapiro had given me the opportunity to you know Kind of try to uncancel me. Yes. Hey, we\\'ll do a movie with you come on out And let\\'s just do a movie and try to get you know, you uncanceled. Yes And so I went out to Nashville thinking that we were gonna shoot a movie there. We didn\\'t shoot it there We ended up shooting up in Montana pray Montana What a great town that yeah Oh yeah, I love Montana. Yeah. And so we shot this $2 million Western movie during like, you know, the time where SAG Aftra was starting to mandate the vaccines and COVID tests and masks. And you know, I just said to the Daily Wire gave me the option, you know, we can either do a union movie or we can do a non-union movie. What would be the difference? The difference would be... Well, the difference would be we would have to basically hire more vaccinated people on the union movie just in case they did mandate it, which they ended up mandating it, which is obviously everything I was standing against. And so that wasn\\'t an option for me. But it was an option for the Daily Wire. It was one of their options. Yes. Yeah. And so then their second option was, well, for half the money, so it went from $4 million, you know, exactly $4 million. a two million dollar non-union movie where that would have given so many more people that were struggling at the time for not taking the vax, for not wanting to apply by the COVID restrictions. And so the Daily Wire did put that on my shoulders and said, this is your decision, this is your movie. And I chose to go up and shoot the $2 million Western, which was called Terror on the Prairie. So how? half the budget, but you felt that it was important as a matter of principle not to participate in a Vax mandate. Yeah, I wasn\\'t gonna do that. I mean, you know, Disney didn\\'t, I mean, I didn\\'t cave to Disney, you know what I mean? I\\'m not gonna like go to Nashville and be like, okay, I was so grateful, by the way, for the opportunity that they offered me. But it just, when I got there, it was just two different options that I would, I thought, I, I didn\\'t think that that would work. was what I was showing up to. But they did, you know, they were like, okay, then let\\'s go up and let\\'s make this Western for $2 million. It made it definitely a lot more difficult. It\\'s kind of funny online and on IMDb, they say we shot it for $75 million and they\\'re trying to like write up all these reports that it went into theater and it only made $800. And I\\'m like, no, it actually was just streamed on the Daily Wire. we made it for about two million dollars that I know of, you know, and it could have been less than that. And we, it was never in theater, and you\\'ve got like all of the Hollywood, you know, press, like, look at, you know, and it\\'s even not not, I believe it\\'s still on IMDB listed as 75 million dollars, just to kind of like do these awful things to people like me and the daily wire and like people like you. It\\'s like let\\'s just put as much false information that leads people astrayed. But I ended up being a really good film, Terror on the Prairie. I think there could have been adjustments made that made it better, but I love the performances in it. I love the people that made it. Dallas Sonier is a wonderful producer. I loved working with him. And so I had a really good time. So what\\'d you do after that? I disappeared. I think, I knew that after getting canceled and fired. I knew that like even during the daily, even during that daily wire kind of tarot on the prairie stint, I was wounded like a broken animal. And I, I\\'m not sure if you experienced the same thing after what happened with you and Fox, but I, I think everybody handles it maybe differently. Like it to me, it looks like you jumped straight back in and you were like, you know, hustling. I have maybe a different energy where it\\'s like, you know, I got wounded. I got stabbed. Yes. I\\'m very shallow so it\\'s easy to recover. Nust. I think you\\'re just like a certain type of brain that you go forward, right? Yeah, have to. And mine was, I\\'ve not been like that. Like when I\\'ve been wounded in relationships or in life, like I get hurt, I\\'m sensitive. So for two years I\\'ve been in this kind, in this, you know, kind of desert, you know, kind of, you know, like wondering, I\\'m like, oh God. You know, I see justice happening and I see people moving forward and I am not moving forward Like I thought I was going to and like I had you know said I was going to try to and I felt very Just forgotten and then So when you when you were fired from Disney for reasons that no person should ever be fired When you were fired from Disney for reasons that no person should ever be fired, resisting a Vax mandate or not putting your totally insane pronoun, in an email, did you consider suing them then? Yes, yeah. I actually confronted my family lawyer and we talked about it and I was like, you know, if this isn\\'t defamation or if this isn\\'t discrimination, then I don\\'t know what is. If this isn\\'t wrongful doing of an employee, I don\\'t know what is. So it\\'s my fault for not telling your story more completely for those who don\\'t know it. It\\'s not simply that they fired you right? It\\'s that they defamed you. They, I mean, and harassed and discriminated and just put me through the struggle session, which I didn\\'t know when you\\'re going through it. You don\\'t know that, you know, you\\'re like, I was so naive at 2020. I haven\\'t been living in the political realm at all. Yes. I just pay my taxes and, you know, hustle for that next job, you know, that next action job or that next drama job. And that\\'s just what I\\'ve been trying to do for my entire life, besides my fighting. career. And so then it was just like when 2020 hit, it\\'s like the shades got opened. And I started actually like looking around thinking, wait a second, wait a second, what\\'s happening here? Like, why are people allowed to riot on the streets and they\\'re not allowed to go to church? And why are big businesses staying open and small businesses are getting shut down? And, you know, it was just, it bothered me. It\\'s like people forcing masks on each other and I, I, and and intrinsically new lockdowns are going to be devastating to people. This is coming from a person who has been on and off work. I know what it\\'s like to not work for a year and not work for three years and not to work. When you take away that consistency, it does such an emotional, mental, spiritual thing on you that some people don\\'t know how to handle. They start drugs, alcohol, addiction, and that\\'s exactly what we\\'ve seen. We\\'ve seen all of this. addiction and all this problem, you know, deaths and I\\'ve lost two friends to overdoses, you know, one to turbo cancer, one to I believe a vaccine, what\\'s it called? Injury. Injury, yeah. And then I\\'ve lost so I\\'ve lost so many people in the last six years or the last four years that it\\'s just like mind blowing, which is just a whole other subject. it does make me feel like I was, I stood up for the right thing. I\\'m not sorry I did. It hasn\\'t made things easy, but yeah, I was, so I did try to go and talk to a lawyer.

What was the lawyer\\'s response and what was your thinking about it at the time? You know, like I had to get out of LA because my life was not safe there, at least where I was at, and you know, it\\'s pretty expensive to live in. LA and so it\\'s either like moving to keep keep in LA or you know try to move to maybe Nashville and see if that daily wire thing works out. Well that didn\\'t really you know pan out which you know it\\'s not like there\\'s no bad blood there it\\'s just it\\'s not where I you know it\\'s not where God wanted me I don\\'t think. Yes. And so then I just kept on going and I ended up in Montana. How\\'d you end up in Montana? We ended up shooting terror on the prairie there. you liked it so much you stayed? I just being outside and looking at the sky and being able to breathe and not feeling that anxiety of a city or the possible riots coming down the streets and just you know there\\'s an interesting thing I feel like in Montana you know people mind their business basically yes and keep to themselves and I feel like in Montana you have to work your land. You have to have a certain toughness during the winter. And I think that\\'s really cool. So, Montana\\'s not a place where weak people go to live. And I like to be surrounded by that energy. By strong people. Yeah. And so when I, me and my lawyer were talking about it, my family lawyer, he\\'s such a wonderful man. He was like, Gina, I think it\\'s important that you get somewhere safe and take care of that first. And so I did. And relocating your life as, I\\'m sure you\\'ve been through plenty of times in your life is, you know, it\\'s not like like an easy thing, changing a job, changing of a life perspective, you know, and then having to completely uproot and move your life and figure out where you belong. You know, all of that has been going on the last two years and a lot of positive things too. I look at, you know, relationships and friendships and future different. You know, I could have ended up in New York and single and future different. You know, I could have ended up in New York and single at some point. And now I\\'ve been in New York really value a partnership and I really value a future with someone and it\\'s just like my whole maybe that\\'s just called maturity but I was a really late in maturity part. My little sister is a lot. My little sister is a lot more mature than me and she\\'s got three kids and she\\'s like any day Gina any day. I\\'m like well you, I don\\'t know about the kids part, but did your spiritual perspective change? Oh, it I\\'ve always been a Christian. But I never felt so much like a Christian as I do these last few years and it just keeps growing. And, you know, I think that\\'s something that makes people cringe and I\\'ve seen that happen. Why does it make people cringe when you say that? Well, I think, you know, religion and any type of, you know, it\\'s been used so wrongly, you know, some, it\\'s been used so aggressively and wrongly to persuade people in evil, you know, ways. that are fake and it\\'s really turned people off because usually when people go to God or go to a place of God they\\'re searching because they\\'re hurt and they\\'re wounded and when you are hurt and wounded and then you get hurt and wounded by the person, the people are a place that you feel is supposed to protect and be the safe place, I think then people just get really angry at God. And I don\\'t think that it\\'s God that maybe they\\'re angry at. It\\'s at the experience, you know. Yes, the people claiming to represent him. Yeah, so I really haven\\'t been to church, an actual church, probably in 20 years. But I, in the last three years have just grown so much closer and understanding. And so it was actually at that point where I said, you know, I was like, God, you know, all these people are getting justice, you know, and I I was so, I know I was done so wrong. It was so wrong what happened to me. And I know that there\\'s so much more wrong that happened to so many other people. And so I even felt like, you know, like, don\\'t be a brat about this, you know, like, there\\'s, you know, doctors and lawyers and police officers and nurses. And, you know, this is like, awful things are happening all around to everybody. And so I just, I started looking at my justice as, you know, was starting over in Montana. being able to see the big sky and just being so grateful for my surroundings. And then finally, it was really interesting when I finally got that out of my heart and truly gave it over to God and it was just like, it\\'s yours. If I stay in the desert of work and I never work again in this business, then okay, then I need to learn a different skill. You know, I need to figure out what I\\'m gonna do. And so I had to really let it go. genuinely let it go. And a week later, well, yeah, that took years. I tried to pretend like I was there so many times, but to genuinely let that last inch of like, it\\'s gonna be okay and I\\'m gonna give it to you. And a week later, I got an email, a week later, I got an email from X and they said that they were some lawyers that were taking... up cases that people had possibly been fired for speaking their opinion on X. And they\\'d like to hear my case. So they approached you? Over email. Elon Musk\\'s lawyers just found you? Yeah. I don\\'t even know how to. And said, by the way, we\\'d like to pay for your case? Yeah, well, no, no, it didn\\'t go like that. It was, I was, first of all, it was like, is this a scam? Yeah, it sounds like a scam. Right, and I was like, like some sort of scam. So I like, you know, had my lawyers look into them to make sure my family lawyer, no, I\\'ve never paid a dime to and he has just, you know, he\\'s actually my brothers or my sister\\'s husband\\'s cousin. And here he is just like taken on like my problems just with a smile. And I was like, do you think he can, you know, will lemko, by the way, I love you. Well, he\\'s been and such a wonderful person to me. He was just like, these people are legit. These are actually legit lawyers, get back to them. And so I said, because Will believes in my case, he just knew my personal circumstance was very difficult at the time and didn\\'t have the money to pay for that. I needed to put that money into restarting life. And so he\\'s like, call them back. And so, or email them back. And I emailed them back immediately. And I was like ready. And Edward Trent, who is at the law firm, just an incredible man. He was like, wow. He was like, we\\'ve emailed a lot of people and you got it back to us like pretty fast, you know? And then from there on, and the last, you know, I guess it\\'s been, that was before Christmas and it was probably in November, I guess it\\'s been, that was before Christmas and it\\'s, you know, probably in November, I think. They\\'ve, we\\'ve just been like, I\\'m sending them everything and I\\'m telling them my story and we\\'re having long conversations and they\\'re listening to everything that happened and then you know, I\\'m sending in them emails that transpired between me and Disney and publicists and all the other people and I\\'m saying everything I\\'ve got and they they took that to X and Elon and said We believe in this case very much so, very much so. and they presented it to X and then X is like, you know, they had to get the permission from them. So I\\'m sure X has their lawyers looking through it because it\\'s a completely different law firm. Yes, retained by X. Yes, so I\\'m sure X has their own people that are looking at it as well. So there\\'s multiple eyes on this. And then they had to take it to Elon and, you know, brief him on it. And then, you know, they came back and, you know, brief him on it. And then, you know, they came back and they said, we\\'re taking it on. Let\\'s do this, we\\'re gonna write it down. a complaint and we\\'re going to file. I mean, that\\'s just an amazing story. Yeah. Hey, it\\'s Tucker Carlson. Thanks a lot for watching that conversation with Gina Carano, who is a very cool person. You may have noticed that a lot of the e-commerce sites online are run by people who don\\'t share your values and may actually despise you. Creepy tech oligarchs, first and foremost, selling your data the highest bidder, also selling you garbage from third world countries, not helping anyone but them. But there is an alternative. There\\'s a marketplace. trying to change the way this worked. It\\'s called Public Square. And it\\'s got a new way of conducting e-commerce by connecting you with 80,000 small businesses who make things you can feel happy to buy. Not guilty at all. You\\'re working for good, not evil. It\\'s worth checking out. You can go to publicsquare.com slash Tucker. I heard Elon say something or read, some statement where he said, well, anyone whose free speech on X has been used against them can have a free speech. or lawyers looking at it, what do you, I mean. And I responded to that, which I, you know, I didn\\'t think that anything would ever come of it, but he, he tweeted that out. And I said, you know, in a quote to you, I said, well, I think that, I think I qualify or something like that smiley face. And nothing happened for months. And I was like, okay, well, you know, I didn\\'t expect anything. So, and then when that happened and I got that email, it was like, it\\'s one of those. There\\'s been a couple of those calls in my life or a couple of those moments in my life that I\\'ve just... I\\'ve just been like, oh my gosh, like, I get a chance right now. I get a fighting chance to clear my name, to let the world know what happened here, to, you know, the world\\'s a lot, got come a lot, you know, a long ways in three years. A lot of information\\'s come out. Yes. So, I mean, you shouldn\\'t get fired for being ahead of the curve. I mean I shouldn\\'t have gotten fired for you know talking about lockdowns and masks and encouraging that, I was encouraging conversation. I shouldn\\'t have gotten fired for my supposedly controversial tweets. They were not controversial. They were just having trouble with where I was coming from, I think. It\\'s bewildering. Like it\\'s mind-blowing what happened to my friends. Do you have any idea why, I mean, even very rich people rarely pick up pay for lawyers, for strangers on principle. I mean, do you know why Elon Musk is doing this? You know, I\\'ve never even met him. I\\'ve never even spoken to him. I think he\\'s retweeted me once. And he\\'s doing that, that\\'s not only for me, in this big case, he\\'s doing this for many other people. And I think there\\'s just, I think we\\'re living in a time of of such an incredible person that would be fighting for free speech on the biggest level. I mean, if we did not have what Elon Musk is doing right now, so many of us would be in such deep trouble. Nations would be in trouble. And I respect what he\\'s doing and I don\\'t know why he\\'s doing it, I think that a lot of billionaires put their money into more selfish things and he\\'s choosing to put his money into the defense of free speech and the defense of injustice and I Have to imagine, you know, I have to imagine that I had to do something with the may musk his mother Because I follow her too and I think You know how heartbreaking it it\\'s been for my family to watch me go through this hardship. And I really wonder about the Musk family. and what tough skin they must have had, but what an incredibly classy woman that woman is. And I love following her because I see this came from somewhere, you know? And yeah, I just think what an incredible family that has burdened such a tough moment in time that I think that he will go down in history has burdened such a tough moment in time that I think that he will go down in history as one of the greats. As will you Tucker? Well, I\\'m not doing anything like that. I\\'m just talking on camera. No, no, no. That\\'s a pretty generous thing to be doing for people you don\\'t know. I mean- Never even spoken to him. So tell us- I hope I get to thank him one day like and shake his hand and you know, I don\\'t know like how you think someone like this, you know like just, thank you Elon for fighting this fight for so many of us. It is unbelievable. And it\\'s just, I don\\'t know anybody like this person, and I don\\'t even know this person. Amazing. So what\\'s the suit like, and it goes without saying that we\\'re fervently rooting for you and for justice in this case, but tell us about the suit. Well, my lawyers, yeah, they said, you know, keep the lawyer talk to the lawyer talk, right? So I don\\'t stick myself in any bad situation. So I kind of leave that up to them. It\\'s all in the complaint. They filed the complaint. It\\'s February 6th, and Disney now has a certain amount of time to respond to that complaint. And so, yeah, that\\'s... But basically the substance, as I understand it, you\\'re fired unfairly in violation of the law and then defamed. Tell us about the defamation. Tell us what they did to you. in more specific terms. Well, there is defamation, I\\'m not sure. If that\\'s a legal claim, I mean, I should as well as a non-lawyer. But they trashed you. They did, they did. What they really did was they put out this awful, so I put up a tweet that has become infamous tweet of saying that, and I don\\'t even know, because I just put it up in like a story section, I didn\\'t post it. I put it in like the, you know, quick everybody look through like the stories of the tweet because tweets used to have the fleet section. And it was basically saying that it didn\\'t start like, uh, you know, Nazi Germany didn\\'t start just with people just waking up being Nazis and like, you know, demonizing, you know, like throwing people, Jews into the concentration camps. It didn\\'t start there. It started before that. It started with propaganda. It started with, you know, um, you know, you had to kind of start urging people to make it okay to demonize your neighbor and to hate people for whatever difference as it was at that time, it was Jewish people. And that\\'s where it started. And that\\'s what made it so much easier for you\\'re living in a house, and then the Nazis come in there, your next door neighbor is getting hauled off that maybe years before you guys were all having dinner and having this wonderful relationship. And then it gradually happened. It just wasn\\'t something that happened just like that. And that was what the meme meant to me. was that I was trying to tell people now, like don\\'t demonize each other, understand we\\'re all human beings still, and basically just bad things have happened in the past and to learn from the past. And I thought that was something that everyone, Democrats, Republicans, independents, that everybody could understand and get. I thought that was a tweet for everybody. And the... the Hollywood press and every major news and media that they came against me and they said, she just, she compared Republicans to the Jewish Holocaust and she\\'s denigrating the Jewish community. Wait, so you came out against the Nazis, but they claimed you were pro-Nazis. They called me, they smeared me as an anti-Semite, smeared me. And I was like, your pro-Nazi. And why did people believe in it? But, you know, like, and then what Disney did was they put out a statement that said, we are no longer working with her. There is there is a statement when we\\'re no longer working with Gina Carano. We basically think that she\\'s denigrating people off of their cultural and religious beliefs. And she they said something about me being important. For your anti-Nazi. tweet. Yeah. for less costs, reliable sales, marketing campaigns to love and more.

So you obviously noticed since you worked in the business, but I mean, people who write about television and movies are directed to the word by the PR departments at the television and movie companies. So there\\'s no independent press that writes about the movies or about television, even cable news. You know what it means? I mean, like the big cable news websites are all controlled by the PR departments. Right. That\\'s true in Hollywood. And that\\'s really been, you know, so I had my own, had hired my own publicist during, you know, season two of The Mandalorian. And they were working with the publicists from the Disney people. And then they were working with the UTA who dropped me immediately as well. Of course they do. And then- Your agent who\\'s there fighting as well. Of course they do. Uh-huh. And then, uh... Your agent who\\'s there fighting for you! Yeah, all of them. I mean... And then the entertainment lawyer dropped me. Of course. And the funny thing is like the entertainment lawyer, I think was, they would constantly be sending out, hey, we\\'re having this Democrat at my house, come on over, raise some funds for the Democrat party, da-da-da, or whoever the candidate was that they were. And so all of these people just dropped me immediately. And I was like. People you\\'d been paying to stand by your side in case there was a big problem. Yeah. The second there was a big problem. They fled and denounced you yes immediately may they all rot And I was just like okay That\\'s so much you know, I mean I knew that like maybe something could happen where Disney would might be like hey, you know As professionals I thought maybe they just go okay Well, maybe we\\'re gonna not work with you or maybe something like that could happen by speaking out about the things that I spoke out about. the things that I spoke out about were so much more important than the career part because I felt like, you know, we needed to be talking about, we\\'re headed in a really bad direction. Oh, yes. You know, the lockdowns, the mask mandates, the vaccines, you know, I felt like we needed to, I never even said who I was really voting for. I was just, I was getting really pushed into this, like, you\\'re an extremist, you\\'re an outright extremist, you know. And so I thought maybe that that could be an option, but never in my wildest dreams. of his dreams that I thought that they would have through Twitter or through a publication without even calling me. This is how I found out I was fired online on Twitter. Like they didn\\'t call me. They didn\\'t say we\\'re letting you go. We\\'re no longer going to work together. This is why, you know, it was just she\\'s denigrating people off of cultural and religious beliefs and she\\'s abhorrent. And I was like, I don\\'t know. for coming out against the Nazis. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So backwards. Yeah. But again, you know that when you get attacked in the Hollywood trade press, that\\'s because the company you worked for directed those reporters to. Right. And I\\'m learning that more and more. So now, when there\\'s like a piece that somebody writes about me, I go and I look up the journalist and I go and I look up the journalist and I go and I look up the journalist and I go and I look up the journalist and I go and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and I look up the journalist and and look at what other articles has this journalist written. Of course. And you can almost just trace it back. And a couple, I traced right back to Lucas Foam. And I was like, right there, you guys, you call up your people and it\\'s ugly. It\\'s very ugly. Well, it\\'s the most dishonest thing ever. Yeah. A reporter at the Hollywood Reporter or wherever. Yeah. And it\\'s all involved, right? It\\'s the agencies, it\\'s the managers, it\\'s... the publicist, it\\'s a studios, and it\\'s just this big mafioso that does not give the independent artist unless they\\'re willing to comply and fit in 100% into that ideologies and their narratives and be basically these manufactured robots. You know, I mean, I feel like there\\'s the 1% of Hollywood that can do what they want and say and think what they want. And those are the very, very talented people. But at the peak of my career, it was like, you know, I think they thought, let\\'s make an example out of this one. For sure. She\\'s an action actress. You know, she hasn\\'t done, you know, drama yet. She hasn\\'t gotten there. We\\'ll make an example out of her. And it had the complete opposite effect, which was just overwhelming support. It was pretty funny, like, as soon as they, they were at the peak of their stock. market ever in February 2021. Yeah, in February 2021. And right when they fired me is when it started plummeting to what it is now. And you\\'re obviously very smart people and they\\'re trying to salvage it, but people saw. They saw what was going on. In my case, it was very obvious. Do your friends who were still there? Yeah, you know, everybody I worked physically with. I never had a problem with. And, you know, like, you know, me and Pedro reconnected after, you know, Karl Weathers passed away. Yes. And, you know, there was all these lies and all these weird stories and that people make up in their heads. And, you know, one thing I can say is, you know, I adore Pedro. And he know, one thing I can say is, you know, I adore Pedro. And he said one thing to me. He said, and Carl were protectors. And that means so much to me that he remembers me and our time together as me being a protector. And it\\'s important, like, people don\\'t know what the real story is. Like, why do you think Pedro\\'s calling me a protector? To his fans, I want, you know, there\\'s a reason. And there\\'s stories that you don\\'t know that have to do with it. happened and I was there and I protect people. There was a person multiple times, that\\'s just my nature. There was a person who was wearing a mask on set and they were at their end. They were over time and they were crying and they were upset and they couldn\\'t do it anymore. They just couldn\\'t. They were broken. There was a broken person in that mask and I, nobody he was saying anything and I just simply went up to the director at the time and I said, this person\\'s done. They\\'re done. They need that. They need their, they need the contacts out. They need the thing off their head. They need a breathe. They\\'re broken. And the director and I was like, look, I, you know, and I worked longer, longer hours than maybe probably any actor because my face was showing and I did all my own stunts. So if you go back and you look at the camera, you can see that I\\'m not wearing a mask. at like the work records. You\\'re gonna find who was on set the most as like the actors and you\\'re gonna find me at the top of that list. And I said, I\\'ll, you know, get my coverage tonight. I know you guys wanted to do it, you know, the next day, you can get my coverage tonight. You give this man a break and I will, you know, I\\'ll stay later and, you know, push my time and I\\'ll show up early and you know, don\\'t worry about it. But I\\'ve done that on numerous sets and that\\'s You know because I do understand that like well I come from a fighter\\'s background and and I Want it and I wanted it so bad that I feel like I can If I can have the energy to push it and I can do it and it crushes me when people are broken Or hurting or being bullied. Yes, and which was my whole purpose of speaking out You know in 2020 was just- The weakest, I believe the most, as always. A lot of people- that you know I was usually very introverted I you know get really nervous for interviews although that\\'s getting better I get nervous for public speaking I get nervous for performing but when I\\'m passionate when I mean something that\\'s when I can speak and that\\'s the only reason why I\\'m probably able to speak with you right now is because I have a clear heart about what happened I want the lawyers to look into it. I want the professionals to see what happened and how Ludicris and all of that is going to be done. absurd it was and I want things to change so that it doesn\\'t happen to other people. What\\'s your next chapter? Well, my next chapter is going to be, I\\'m going to make a movie. I\\'m going to produce and possibly direct it. I am going to do it. I\\'m going to produce and possibly direct it. I am going to do it. I\\'m going to get it financed. I don\\'t know how yet. but I\\'m going to make some art and it\\'s going to be truly inclusive. And I think that\\'s going to be a gift that\\'s where my heart has been. I thought I was going to get that a couple years ago with the DIY, or I thought that was the path that was going to happen. But I\\'m, you know, I think God\\'s teaching me a lesson right now of how to do this, how to learn how to put this together and how to attract the people that you want to work with. with and you know I I lost my team when I got canceled you know so I didn\\'t have anybody and so the rebuilding of a life and everything has been my focus in the last two years well I\\'ve I\\'ve rebuilt that now and you know there\\'s still things that I need to you know do I need to rebuild my body you know a lot of stress and not working and you know depression and all of that I need to focus on my health that\\'s very that\\'s at the top of my list and I\\'ve been saying that. But also to get creative and I think that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen. I think that\\'s what I wanna do is I wanna direct and produce a movie and start being more in control of getting my stories out there that I like. I think being in control is a good thing at this point. Yeah. Well, I hope you\\'ll come back when you do that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Tucker. It\\'s just a great story.
