            "What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a  fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works?",
            "There's the glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right?",
            "But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the  particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works?",
            "We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work,  right?",
            "But understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right?",
            "I do think to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general  principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity  that go beyond just the human brain, right?",
            "Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device?",
            "A computer is a general-purpose machine, right?",
            "That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right?",
            "And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd,  feels very differently about this, right?",
            "Do you think of intelligence in this way?",
            "and Martin Rie said, so what is not a computer?",
            "I'm not sure, because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then  everything is, right?",
            "You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation?",
            "Yeah, and you bits kind of with you bits basically, right?",
            "So do we want to do we want to digress a little bit?",
            "Space expands, right?",
            "So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom?",
            "So where did they come from?",
            "So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more integral?",
            "So at which point is most of the entanglement happening?",
            "Are we talking about close to the Big Bang?",
            "What do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation?",
            "And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate?",
            "You know, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be?",
            "I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see?",
            "Okay?",
            "So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources that they don't render the entire universe, right?",
            "That that the part that is out there that two trillion galaxies isn't actually being simulated fully, okay?",
            "But then the obvious  extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully like the rest of you are just part non-player characters, right?",
            "Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics the way Nick Bostrom phrases it if  Is it if it's possible to simulate a universe eventually we'll do it right?",
            "But there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but  probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating to our little artificial beings,  there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right?",
            "So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible,  It's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right?",
            "Well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right?",
            "So do you think there is intelligent life?",
            "The question I'd like to ask is, what would intelligent life look like?",
            "We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right?",
            "And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals  wastefully in all directions into the universe?",
            "The reason why we don't think about that is  because we're young and impatient, right?",
            "And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if  you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get  there, right?",
            "And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we go faster  than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right?",
            "And once you do that, then the stars are much closer, effectively, right?",
            "What's a hundred-year trip, right?",
            "Well, it's in a race against time, right?",
            "no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known  and unknown, right?",
            "What kind of questions can science not currently answer but might soon?",
            "But starting life from non-life is something I kind of think we're close to, right?",
            "Like how difficult does it to start life?",
            "The right now the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right?",
            "Yeah, however again we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say  Homo sapiens the  The modern the modern intelligence in our human brain  Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is?",
            "So AI would count in this or you really want life?",
            "You want really an organism in some sense?",
            "But let's say artificial consciousness, right?",
            "No, actually, I like this idea that in fact consciousness is way less mysterious than we  think because we're all at every time at every moment less conscious than we think we are,  right?",
            "but you put them in a body, right?",
            "And what you want to  say is, yeah, but they're just robots, it's not really pain, right?",
            "And it could be that the future  is, I mean, Siri is close, right?",
            "As it's a high probability at this time, because  Because the, yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right?",
            "Photos you can't trust, right?",
            "We're getting better at faking them, right?",
            "Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that?",
            "We're very bad, right?",
            "Yeah, exactly, again, opinions are free, right?",
            "So what kind of questions can science not currently answer  may never be able to answer in your view?",
            "Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad?",
            "You know, what is right and wrong?",
            "And so the  question is how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations?",
            "How  do you think about these conversations?",
            "How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations?",
            "How can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of  conversations?",

            "And he's like, why are you asking me?",
            "So, and likewise, you know, you asked me like, how do you get to like have interdisciplinary  conversations and all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people?",
            "And like that's, that's what makes me go, right?",
            "In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all  these books that I had purchased, right?",
            "And now if I have the motivation because I'm going to interview Pat Churchland, I'm going  to finally read her book, you know?",
            "And it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right?",
            "And in fact, when we do, it's punished, you know?",
            "If you're a young person, I have  graduate students and I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's most  graduate students do not become faculty members, right?",
            "You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right?",
