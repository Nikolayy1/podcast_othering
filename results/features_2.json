            "Is there some way to control the actual mechanism of delivery in response to what the body is doing?",
            "So from an AI robotics perspective, how close are these drug delivery systems to something like a robot?",
            "Or is it totally wrong to think about them as intelligent agents?",
            "And how much room is there to add that kind of intelligence into these delivery systems, perhaps in the future?",
            "So do you think it's possible that there could be robotic type systems roaming our body sort of long term and be able to deliver certain kinds of drugs in the future?",

            "What is tissue engineering or regenerative medicine?",
            "So what are the various ways to generate tissue?",
            "And how do, so is it, you know, the one is of course from stem cells, is there other methods?",
            "So is there a possibility to weave into the scanrids a computational component?",
            "So if we talk about electronic chips, some ability to sense, control some aspect of this growth process for the tissue?",
            "So what kind of tissues can we engineer today?",
            "What, yeah, what kind of tissue?",
            "But what does that, does that mean that it's some kind of healing and treatment of different conditions for human beings?",
            "Okay, so skin, what else?",
            "What about neural tissue?",
            "And the nervous system and even the brain?",

            "How do you solve that kind of challenge?",
            "I mean, it's exciting to think about future possibilities of tissue engineering is, uh, do you see some tissues more difficult than others?",
            "What are the possibilities here?",
            "What do you think that means for longevity?",
            "If we look maybe not someday, but 10, 20 years out, the possibilities that tissue engineering, the possibilities of the research that you're doing, does it have a significant impact on the longevity of human life?",
            "What's the most beautiful scientific idea in bioengineering that you've come across in your years of research?",
            "Do you see that if you look at medicine or bioengineering, do you see that there is these big leaps that happen every decade or so or some distant period, or is it a lot of incremental work?",

            "and then you look at C, does it treat the disease better than whatever the gold standard was before that?",
            "So how, again, if you can linger it a little bit, how does the patenting process work?",
            "Well, that's not always said So what what value what?",
            "I think the business aspects are you have to Be a good judge of people so that you hire the right people for all these different things, and knowing that medical research is so expensive, what thing are you gonna do first, second, third, fourth, and fifth?",
            "I mean, the kinds of things that I would think about is the market big or small, are there wouldn't take 50 years, are the clinical trials that could be set up, ones that have clear endpoints where you can make a judgment, and another issue would be competition, are there other ways that some companies out there are doing it?",

            "Does it affect the science or is it, or can you simply along with that?",
            "So if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist, how hard is that problem?",
