            "And so far the results have been if you scale the computer, scale the data, it does better and would that work?",
            "And so that was the first year or two can we prove that out, right?",
            "What were the wins like?",
            "Yeah, so what would What was the sort of dream of what this could become?",
            "What were their echoes of this open source TensorFlow community that might be brought in?",
            "Was there a sense of TPUs?",
            "Was there a sense of like machine learning is not going to be at the core of the entire company is going to grow into that direction?",
            "So do you remember those discussions happening?",
            "Are there open source should be happening?",
            "What was that like?",
            "So how does cloud fit into that?",
            "And how does the fact that you can use so many of the resources that Google provides and the cloud fit into that strategy?",
            "So TensorFlow itself is open, and you can use it anywhere, right?",
            "Can you tell me the history and the timeline of TensorFlow project in terms of major design decisions, like the open source decision, but really, what to include and not?",
            "When you say mobile, you mean like pretty complicated algorithms running on the phone?",
            "Maybe did that influence any design decisions?",
            "There's what other libraries?",
            "What was that discussion like with in terms of using graphs?",
            "It seemed, it's kind of the theano way, did it seem the obvious choice?",
            "So, graph did come from that when we thought of, okay, should we do that in Python and we experiment with some ideas where But not having a graph went, okay, how do you deploy now?",
            "And I guess the question there is, did you, I mean, as a production seems to be the really good thing to focus on, but did you even anticipate the other side of it where there could be, what is it, what are the numbers, something crazy, a 41 million downloads?",
            "like a possibility in your mind that it would be as popular as it became?",
            "41 million?",
            "and how do we enable that?",
            "So what changed once the open source?",
            "global population of developers, what, how do the projects start changing?",
            "Is that the version?",
            "What changed leading into 1.0?",
            "Um, I think what that changed was instead of deep learning being a research thing, some people who were just developers could now take this out and do some interesting things with it, right?",
            "Even less than at 50 is what?",
            "And then there's the the research crowd, which wants, okay, they want to do these crazy things exactly like you're saying, right?",
            "So I would say for the hobbyist perspective, that's the most common case, right?",
            "I have people like lawyers come up to me and say, when is machine learning gonna enter legal, the legal realm?",
            "Do you also find yourself being in the role of?",
            "Do you get those have those conversations?",
            "I you know, I get all kinds of questions there from Okay, what do I need to make this work, right?",
            "Do we really need deep learning?",
            "Why would this help?",
            "Is there a good answer?",
            "Are you finding yourself also the organizer of datasets?",
            "Yes, I think with TensorFlow datasets that we just released, that's definitely come up where people want these datasets, can we organize them and can we make that easier?",
            "Do you know when?",
            "Keras chose to also Add TensorFlow as a back-end who was the was it just the community that drove that initially?",
            "Do you know if there was discussions conversations?",
            "TensorFlow 2.0, sort of Keras is kind of the recommended way for beginner to interact with TensorFlow, which makes that initial sort of transfer learning or the basic use cases even for enterprise super simple, right?",
            "So what was that decision like?",
            "How are those design decisions made?",
            "Is there a BDFL in TensorFlow, or is it more distributed and organic?",
            "So can you maybe give me whatever I missed, a bigger overview of the mission of the ecosystem that's trying to be built and where's it moving forward?",
            "Can we, you know, how do we enable researchers to build the next amazing thing?",
            "And so the way I think about this ecosystem is how do we help get machine learning on every device that has a compute capability?",
            "And I see our goal as enabling even that, right?",
            "One of the big things about 2.0 that we're pushing on is, okay, we have these so many pieces, right?",
            "How do we help make all of them work well together?",
            "So, I mean, there's a lot of aspects of this you're making look easy, but on the technical side, how many challenges have to be overcome here?",
            "How do we make it really easy for these vendors to integrate with something like TensorFlow, right?",
            "So do you feel the pain of that?",
            "Do you think that's still important given how quickly deep learning is changing?",
            "Can you just, the things that you've learned, can you just start over or is there pressure to not?",
            "I think it's a trade-off, right?",
            "But do you enjoy competition?",
            "Do you enjoy that kind of competition or do you just ignore and focus on making TensorFlow the best that it can be?",
            "We didn't want just research, right?",
            "Now PyTorch came along and said, you know what?",
            "What's the best thing I can do for this?",
            "And there are things you can learn from that, right?",
            "Over time, we had revisited this a couple of times, should we add this again?",
            "You think he wouldn't have been, you know, Muhammad Ali versus Frazier, right?",
            "Do you think it wouldn't have been added as quickly if PyTorch wasn't there?",
            "What other things that we didn't talk about, are you looking forward in 2.0 that comes to mind?",
            "Is there other things that we missed?",
            "Can you elaborate a little bit what you mean by making TensorFlow more ecosystem or modular?",
            "And by people, you mean individual developers and?",
            "So, I'm not sure if you can explain it, but what does it take to build a community like that?",
            "I think there's a number of things that need to come together, right?",
            "Do you have a sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there may be a little bit of a partitioning like there is with Python 2 and 3, that there will be a code base and in the older versions of TensorFlow, they will not be as compatible easily or are you pretty confident that this kind of conversion is pretty natural and easy to do?",
            "So what do you think TensorFlow 3.0 looks like?",
            "Are things happening so crazily that even at the end of this year, it seems impossible plan for or is it possible to plan for the next five years?",
            "Are there some things going to stick around and some things not going to stick around?",
            "Can you do something ground up?",
            "Other things we don't know is will hardware accelerators be the same?",
            "Will we be able to train with four bits instead of 32 bits?",
            "What do you think for beginners is the biggest thing they struggle with?",
            "So what do you look for in a good team?",
            "What do you think?",
            "So in this context, what do you think makes for a good team?",
            "And finally, how do you put that together with somewhat unified vision of where we want to go?",
            "So are we all looking in the same direction or just going all over?",
            "And is there a way you monitor the health of the team?",
            "Sort of like, is there a way you know you did a good job?",
            "The team is good?",
            "But have you had struggle with that?",
            "Has there been challenges?",
            "What is the hardest part of your job?",
            "say, right?",

            "Sometimes it's how do you involve this huge community?",
            "What about deadlines?",
            "Is this defined TensorFlow to be driven by deadlines to a degree that a product might, or is there still a balance to where it's less deadline?",
            "Is 2.0 is their pressure to make that stable?",
            "Do you see TensorFlow 2.0 in that same kind of way?",
            "I don't know if you can say but is there, you know, there's not external deadlines for TensorFlow 2.0 but is there internal deadlines, the artificial or otherwise that you're trying to set for yourself or is it whenever it's ready?",
            "What have you learned from that experience?",

            "I mean, as a model, it's been around for ages, right?",
            "So do you see it moving forward as to continue being a model that funds businesses like Google?",
            "Do you see that continuing and growing and improving or is there GC sort of more Netflix type models where you have to start to pay for content?",
            "So speaking of revenue, how is it that a person can use the TPU in a Google call app for free?",
